# OpenMarketplace Server Core Library

The code inside this folder (root-path/server) shouldn't never be modified for custom projects; Never add code here, in this case. If you are a contributor and have thinking in modify or add some code here, rethink it... probably, you shouldn't do it here :-)

See more on our [code base docs](https://github.com/openmarketplace/openmarketplace/wiki/Code-Base).
